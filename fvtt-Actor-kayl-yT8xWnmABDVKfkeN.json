        "appearance": "<p>Kayl stands just under 3 feet tall with a compact, slender build and very pale skin. Her straight, shoulder-length white hair falls around a finely featured face, where light violet eyes scan her surroundings with focused intensity. She wears an oversized black cloak that drapes nearly to the floor, concealing her form; only her bare, calloused feet peek out beneath the hem. Her stance is squared and upright, weight balanced on both feet, ready to spring into motion at a moment’s notice.</p>",
        "backstory": "<p><span>Kayl lives with a singular, unshakable purpose: to become powerful. Whatever it takes, she will do it.</span></p><p><span>Her story began in eerie silence, when she materialized one day in a forgotten graveyard. She appeared as a 25-year-old halfling—short, stocky, with pale skin and wild, snow-white hair. A nearby gravekeeper, a devout follower of Pharasma, immediately recognized what she was: a Duskwalker, a rare soul charged with the eternal mission of hunting undead. Without hesitation, he took her to a secluded monastery in the mountains, where monks practiced martial arts to hone body and spirit alike.</span></p><p><span>Despite her determination, Kayl struggled. Her small frame made it difficult to match the physical prowess of the other monks. Still, she endured the grueling training, never once giving up. Then one day, while in town collecting supplies, she stumbled upon something that changed her path entirely: a street magician, flamboyantly conjuring fire and lightning, mesmerizing crowds with illusions and flair. Though clearly a performer rather than a warrior, the display sparked something in Kayl. She saw the potential to augment her fighting skills with arcane power.</span></p><p><span>The magician, at first, assumed Kayl was just another curious child. But when she spoke, her intensity startled him. In her voice, he heard hunger, ambition—the very things he had lost. Seeing in her a chance to pass on his dormant knowledge, he agreed to teach her.</span></p><p><span>Weeks passed as Kayl struggled with magic. It didn’t come naturally to her as it did to him; she couldn’t feel it in her blood. But through meticulous study and relentless discipline, she began to make progress. She developed her own shorthand, filling notebooks with arcane formulas and motion diagrams. Her magic, while hard-won, was precise and dependable.</span></p><p><span>One day, the magician decided it was time to test her. He cast a forbidden spell, one he had long sworn off: he summoned an undead creature and commanded it to attack. In that moment, something awakened in Kayl. A wave of instinctual revulsion surged through her. Her training and her birthright aligned. She met the attack with an elegant fury, fists cloaked in flame, each movement a blend of monk discipline and arcane force.</span></p><p><span>But she was still too weak.</span></p><p><span>Spell slots depleted, body bruised, she was beaten down. The magician, now changed, revealed his true face. His grin was cruel as he declared, \"Too long has it been since I let loose. You’ve been a delightful apprentice, truly... but now, it's time for you to become my newest vessel!\"</span></p><p><span>There was a blinding explosion of fire and force. Kayl thought she had died.</span></p><p><span>Yet she awoke. Not in the forest glade where the betrayal occurred, but in a vast, glittering city teeming with adventurers, warriors, and mages of all kinds. Somehow, she had survived. Somehow, she had been transported.</span></p><p><span>She looked around at the spires and streets of this unfamiliar metropolis and felt the fire ignite again within her.</span></p><p><span>\"I don’t know where I am,\" she said aloud, \"but I can already see it. I can become strong here.\"</span></p><p><span>And with that, Kayl’s true journey began.</span></p>",

          "value": "<p>Through dedicated study and practice, you can construct spells with academic rigor by shaping arcane magic. You are a spellcaster, and you can cast spells of the arcane tradition using the Cast a Spell activity. As a wizard, when you cast spells, your incantations likely specify exactly what forces you call on and how to shape them, and your gestures precisely shape and direct your magic while circles of arcane runes flare to life.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, you can prepare up to two 1st-rank spells and five cantrips each morning from the spells in your spellbook (see below), as well as one extra curriculum cantrip and one extra curriculum spell of each rank you can cast from your arcane school. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a wizard, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest rank of spell you can cast, as shown in the Wizard Spells per Day table.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Intelligence, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Intelligence modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear on page 403.</p><h3>Heightening Spells</h3><p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks.</p><h3>Cantrips</h3><p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of wizard spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level wizard, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level wizard, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p><h3>Spellbook</h3><p>Every arcane spell has a written version, which you record in your personalized book of spells. You start with a spellbook worth 10 sp or less, which you receive for free and must study each day to prepare your spells. Your spellbook's form and name are up to you. It might be a musty, leather-bound tome or an assortment of thin metal disks connected to a brass ring; its name might be esoteric, like <em>The Tome of Silent Shadows</em> or something more academic, like <em>Advanced Pyromantic Applications of Jalmeri Elemental Theory</em>.</p>\n<p>The spellbook contains your choice of 10 arcane cantrips and five 1st-rank arcane spells. You choose these from the common spells on the arcane spell list or from other arcane spells you gain access to. You also add two 1st-rank spells from the curriculum of your arcane school (except in the case of the school of unified magical theory, as described in that school).</p>\n<p>Each time you gain a level, you add two arcane spells to your spellbook, of any spell rank for which you have spell slots, chosen from common spells of your tradition or others you gain access to. You can also add spells to your spellbook with the Learn a Spell activity. When you gain spell slots of a new rank, you also add an additional spell from your school's curriculum (unless it's the school of unified magical theory).</p>",

For example, <em>+1 striking handwraps of mighty blows</em> would give you a +1 item bonus to attack rolls with your unarmed attacks and increase the damage of your unarmed attacks from one weapon die to two (normally 2d4 instead of 1d4, but if your fists have a different weapon damage die or you have other unarmed attacks, use two of that die size instead).</p>\n<p>You can upgrade, add, and transfer runes to and from the handwraps just as you would for a weapon, and you can attach talismans to the handwraps. Treat the handwraps as melee weapons of the brawling group with light Bulk for these purposes. Property runes apply only when they would be applicable to the unarmed attack you're using. For example, a property that must be applied to a slashing weapon wouldn't function when you attacked with a fist, but you would gain its benefits if you attacked with a claw or some other slashing unarmed attack.</p>"
